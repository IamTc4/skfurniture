# SEO Strategy for skfurniture

## Goal
To increase visibility and acquire B2B clients (Schools, Colleges, Coaching Centers) in **Thane, Mumbai, and Pune**.

## 1. On-Page SEO (Implemented)

We have optimized the core pages with high-intent keywords to help you rank when principals and administrators search for suppliers.

### Key Changes Made:
*   **Targeted Meta Titles:** Changed generic titles to location-specific ones (e.g., "School Furniture Manufacturer in Mumbai & Pune").
*   **Meta Descriptions:** Added compelling summaries with keywords and phone numbers to improve Click-Through Rate (CTR).
*   **Schema Markup:** Added `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD to `index.html`. This speaks directly to Google's algorithm, confirming your physical location in Thane and service areas.
*   **Content Injection:** Added "Serving Mumbai, Thane, Pune" to visible text to reinforce local relevance.

## 2. Off-Page Strategy (Your Action Items)

Since we cannot build backlinks programmatically, you must execute the following to build authority:

### A. Google My Business (GMB) - **CRITICAL**
*   **Claim your listing:** Ensure your business is verified on Google Maps at your Thane address.
*   **Categories:** Primary category should be "Furniture Manufacturer" or "School Supply Store".
*   **Photos:** Upload real photos of your factory, showroom, and *installed* projects in schools.
*   **Reviews:** Ask every principal you work with to leave a 5-star review mentioning the school name.

### B. Local Directories
Submit your website to these high-authority local directories:
1.  **Justdial:** Create a free listing targeting "School Furniture" in Thane/Mumbai.
2.  **IndiaMART:** As a B2B manufacturer, this is essential. Create a catalog with "School Bench" and "Lab Table".
3.  **Sulekha / TradeIndia:** Good for citation building.

### C. Content Marketing (Blog)
Write 1 blog post per month focusing on local pain points.
*   *Idea 1:* "Why Schools in Mumbai need Anti-Rust Furniture (Humidity protection)."
*   *Idea 2:* "Top 5 Classroom Layouts for Pune's International Schools."
*   *Idea 3:* "BIS Standards for School Desks: What Thane Principals Need to Know."

## 3. Backlink Strategy
*   **School Partners:** Ask schools where you have installed furniture to put a "Furniture Partner: skfurniture" link on their facilities page.
*   **Local News:** If you launch a new eco-friendly product, send a press release to local Mumbai newspapers/blogs.

## 4. Technical Maintenance
*   **Speed:** Ensure your images are compressed (WebP format recommended).
*   **Mobile:** 60% of searches happen on mobile. Keep the site responsive.
